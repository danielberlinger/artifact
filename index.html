        <h3>Welcome to Artifact.</h3>

<p>There's a lot of information that collects over the course of integrations, environments, testing, and learning. This is an easy to search space to keep that stuff until it gets automated. There's tags, searches, versions, and entries. And not a whole lot more.</p>

<p>After you clone...</p>

<pre><code>$ cd artifact
$ bundle
$rake db:migrate
$rails s
</code></pre>

<p>Way back in June of 2010 my team was really unhappy with the wiki type tools available to us to store the flotsam and jetsom of our development life. All sorts of stuff accrued across the projects we worked on and we needed one place, that wasn’t public, to store all that stuff. We tried a bunch of tools but it got too hard too quickly to find stuff and a few other details that happened to torture us.</p>

<p>No claims are being made that is a be all or end all tool for anyone else, but a few years later it continues to suffice.</p>

<p>I long ago wanted to open source it, but never got around to it. Never mind the shame of never having written a test for anything. It was the classic prototype goes into production deal. I hope to back fill the tests, but in the meantime the ideas are still valid, and if you consider this a prototype, you’ll be fine.</p>

<p>This is not the original repository because I no longer have access to it, but as a bonus, this has been updated so it runs Rails 3.1.x as of this writing. Although some functionality has been eliminated because I don’t have access to the original. That’s cool, it was nothing core anyway.</p>

<p>There’s a few other things that need cleaning up. I didn’t think the original worked the way I wanted… anyway, and as I said I don’t have access to it anyway.</p>

<p>For use, it’s pretty straightforward. Create one entry for each bit of data. Tag it with a comma separated list of tags(no spaces for now) if you care to. Search and ye shall find. Versions are stored, so that folks feel comfortable editing. That’s it for now.</p>

<h3>Changes...</h3>

<p>This project was originally written for the needs of my then current team. Make it what your team needs...</p>
